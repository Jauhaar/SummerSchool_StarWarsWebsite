              <p class="content-body">
                Following her experience on the Death Star, Rey returns to the
                island on Ahch-to. Throughout the course of the film she has
                given in to her aggression, nearly killed her friend by
                unleashing a stream of lightning on a ship, learned that she is
                the descendant of the Sith Lord who reduced the Jedi to numbers
                that they have yet to recover from even half a century later,
                saw a vision of herself as a servant of darkness and stabbed her
                enemy through the chest in anger. Her most recent encounter with
                Kylo was the last straw and Rey has now made the decision to
                follow the example set by Luke and exile herself on the island
                where the Jedi began. Rey scuttles the ship she stole from Kylo
                and throws the repaired lightsaber originally constructed by
                Anakin Skywalker in after it. A ghostly hand snatches the
                lightsaber out of thin air as it's being thrown. It's Luke
                Skywalker. Luke’s conversation with Rey is said to be
                encouraging yet realistically grim in tone. Luke knows first
                hand what it’s like to face Palpatine and that it’s not an easy
                task. Rey must confront Palpatine in the same way that Luke once
                had to confront Vader. Luke encourages Rey by telling her of the
                faith Leia had in her. She saw the potential within her and
                hoped that Rey would be able to restore balance to the Force
                once more just as Anakin once did. Rey supposedly asks to speak
                to Leia at one point, but Luke responds by telling her that Leia
                has not yet completed her training and he can not yet feel her
                distinctive consciousness within the Force. By the end of their
                conversation, Rey is reenergized for the seemingly
                insurmountable task that lies ahead of her and agrees to leave
                the island. Having destroyed the ship she used to come to
                Ahch-to, Luke raises his own X-wing (previously seen submerged
                in the coves of the island) to allow Rey to face Palpatine. In
                addition to the starfighter, Luke gifts Rey with a lightsaber
                that once belonged to Leia. He tells her how Leia left her saber
                with Luke when she stopped training and Luke kept it on him. He
                then points Rey to where he kept it safe in his hut. Rey boards
                the X-wing, armed with the coordinates for Palpatine’s location
                obtained from Vader’s wayfinder and leaves the planet.
